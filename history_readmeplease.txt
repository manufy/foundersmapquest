1) I tried a minimal working version, from a boilerplate from mine,  without all the features in frontend, to get the feeling and start glueing things

2) I developed some enhacements and bug fixes, developing frontend2, with simplified javascript and without require.js, simplifying things

3) I created 2 mockups: mockups/app1-elegant with a greyscale bootstrap theme, and mockups/app2-mobile, with a menu more suited for mobile devices

4) I choosed

5) I merge mockup with frontend2, leaving a MVP (Minimun Viable Product)
